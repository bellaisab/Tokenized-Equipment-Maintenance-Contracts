# Tokenized Equipment Maintenance Contracts (TEMC)

A blockchain-based platform revolutionizing industrial equipment maintenance through tokenized performance contracts.

## Overview

The Tokenized Equipment Maintenance Contracts (TEMC) system creates transparent, automated, and performance-based relationships between industrial equipment owners and maintenance service providers. By tokenizing maintenance agreements and leveraging smart contracts, this platform enables condition-based payments, verifiable service histories, and incentive alignment to maximize equipment uptime and operational efficiency.

## System Architecture

The TEMC platform consists of four primary smart contracts:

1. **Asset Registration Contract**
    - Records detailed specifications of industrial equipment
    - Stores maintenance history and ownership records
    - Tracks equipment lifecycles and operational parameters
    - Maintains digital twin references and IoT device connections
    - Supports equipment warranty verification

2. **Service Agreement Contract**
    - Defines maintenance terms, schedules, and service level agreements
    - Creates tokenized representations of maintenance contracts
    - Establishes performance metrics and acceptable thresholds
    - Manages service provider qualifications and certifications
    - Handles agreement modifications and renewals

3. **Performance Tracking Contract**
    - Monitors real-time equipment performance and operational status
    - Records maintenance activities and outcomes
    - Calculates uptime percentages and efficiency metrics
    - Identifies potential issues through predictive analytics
    - Generates alerts when performance falls below thresholds

4. **Payment Automation Contract**
    - Manages service payments based on verified performance data
    - Implements conditional payment release triggers
    - Calculates performance-based bonuses or penalties
    - Supports escrow functionality for disputed services
    - Provides payment history and financial reporting

## Key Features

- **Performance-Based Compensation**: Payments tied directly to measurable equipment performance
- **Transparent Service History**: Immutable record of all maintenance activities and outcomes
- **Automated Compliance**: Ensures adherence to manufacturer-recommended service schedules
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Leverages IoT data to optimize service timing and prevent failures
- **Transferable Service Contracts**: Tokenized agreements can transfer with equipment ownership
- **Dispute Resolution**: Built-in mechanisms for addressing service quality disagreements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+
- Truffle framework
- Ganache (for local development)
- Web3.js
- Metamask or similar Ethereum wallet

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/temc.git
   cd temc
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```

4. Deploy to local development blockchain:
   ```
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```

### Configuration

1. Configure the network settings in `truffle-config.js` for your target deployment network
2. Set up environment variables for IoT data sources and API keys
3. Configure equipment performance thresholds in `config/performance-metrics.json`

## Usage

### For Equipment Owners

```javascript
// Example: Registering industrial equipment
const assetContract = await AssetRegistration.deployed();
await assetContract.registerEquipment(serialNumber, manufacturer, modelNumber, installationDate, specifications);

// Example: Creating a maintenance service agreement
const serviceContract = await ServiceAgreement.deployed();
await serviceContract.createAgreement(equipmentId, serviceProviderId, terms, scheduledIntervals, performanceMetrics);
```

### For Service Providers

```javascript
// Example: Registering as a certified service provider
const serviceContract = await ServiceAgreement.deployed();
await serviceContract.registerServiceProvider(companyInfo, certifications, specializations);

// Example: Recording completed maintenance
const performanceContract = await PerformanceTracking.deployed();
await performanceContract.logServiceEvent(agreementId, equipmentId, serviceDetails, partsReplaced, technician);
```

### For Equipment Operators

```javascript
// Example: Reporting equipment issues
const performanceContract = await PerformanceTracking.deployed();
await performanceContract.reportIssue(equipmentId, issueDescription, severity, operationalImpact);

// Example: Confirming service completion
await performanceContract.verifyServiceCompletion(serviceEventId, satisfactionRating, comments);
```

## IoT Integration

The platform supports integration with industrial IoT sensors for real-time monitoring:

```javascript
// Example: Connecting IoT data feeds
const performanceContract = await PerformanceTracking.deployed();
await performanceContract.registerIoTDevice(equipmentId, deviceId, dataTypes, updateFrequency);

// Example: Processing IoT data
await performanceContract.processPerformanceData(equipmentId, performanceData, timestamp);
```

## Security Considerations

- **Data Validation**: Verification of IoT data sources to prevent manipulation
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for different stakeholders
- **Smart Contract Auditing**: Regular security audits recommended
- **Dispute Resolution**: Multi-signature requirements for contested performance metrics
- **Data Privacy**: Selective disclosure of proprietary operational data

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify contract functionality:

```
truffle test
```

Test coverage includes:
- Equipment registration and verification
- Service agreement creation and modification
- Performance tracking and metric calculation
- Payment automation and conditional triggers

## Token Economics

The TEMC platform utilizes two token types:

1. **Service Agreement Tokens (SATs)**
    - Represent specific maintenance contracts
    - Can be transferred with equipment ownership
    - Store service terms and performance requirements

2. **Performance Incentive Tokens (PITs)**
    - Used for bonus payments when exceeding performance targets
    - Can be staked by service providers as quality guarantees
    - Tradeable on secondary markets

## Deployment

### Testnet Deployment

For testing on Ethereum testnets:

```
truffle migrate --network sepolia
```

### Production Deployment

For deploying to production networks:

```
truffle migrate --network mainnet
```
